In the 1970s, University of Southern California film students found the stock sound effect and used it in their student films. One of those students was Ben Burtt, who became sound editor on both the <i>Star Wars</i> and <i>Indiana Jones</i> franchises, and used the effect throughout each series. Other filmmakers noticed and incorporated it into their own sound design as a running industry in-joke. Itâ€™s since appeared in <i>Titanic, Reservoir Dogs</i> and <i>Toy Story</i>, as well as countless other films, TV shows and videos. Today, many people encounter the Wilhelm scream via memes, demonstrating how different forms of pop culture influence and inspire each other.</p>",

A darkly comedic thriller, Thiagarajan Kumararaja&#8217;s 2019 feature Super Deluxe swept the international film festival circuit and fascinated audiences with its ambitious visual style. &#8220;Thiagarajan Kumararaja&#8217;s unstable mix of dark comedy, brutal thriller and Douglas Sirkian melodrama is shamelessly excessive but undeniably entertaining,&#8221; said Variety. Kumararaja&#8217;s first film in eight years, Super Deluxe wove together four different stories, all depicted with an amazingly vivid colour palette.</p>",

Hangers &#8230; ever!&#8221; The now famous line from 1981 kitsch classic Mommie Dearest depicted coat hangers as the bane of Joan Crawford&#8217;s existence (among other things). And while that might be true in the context of this docudrama, they&#8217;ve also been a consistent presence on film sets since the dawn of the moving image. Practical and ingenious, coat hangers come in all shapes and sizes. This simple domestic object has been handmade or manufactured in wood, metal, plastic or wire. (The wire ones could also be bent into a map-of-Australia car aerial!) Coat hangers are an essential tool in the costume department.</p>",
